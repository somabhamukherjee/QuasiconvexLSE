Instruction for replication of Figure 5 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04433.pdf.
1. Create a subfolder named "data" in your working directory. We will save simulation outputs there.
2. Run "Replication_Code_For_Figure5.R" as "in_ind" varies from 0 to 600.
3. Run "CollectCode.R" to combine and summarize the data files in the subfolder "data".
4. Run "PlotCode.R" on the summerized data file created by "CollectCode.R" to get figure similar to Figure 5 of "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04433.pdf"

"qconvexify_2d.R" and "monotonize.R" were kindly provided to us by the authors of "Shape- enforcing operators for point and interval estimators.". Special thanks to Scott Kostyshak for his help with the above files.
